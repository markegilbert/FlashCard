    "answer": "SHARED COMPUTE: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources can't scale out.  DEDICATED COMPUTE: The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.  ISOLATED COMPUTE: The Isolated and IsolatedV2 tiers run dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.",

    "question": "What are deployment slots, and how are they used in Azure App Service?",
    "answer": "It's where the app will run.  You can have slots designated as stage and production (for example); you'd deploy to stage, then swap with the production slot.  This minimizes downtime and makes rollbacks very easy. Deployment slots are only supported with the Standard pricing tier or higher (not Free or Shared).",
